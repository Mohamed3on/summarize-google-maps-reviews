# Summarize Google Maps Reviews Extension

This extension summarizes Google Maps reviews into a digestible score, allowing you to quickly assess the overall quality of a place without reading all the reviews. It prioritizes trusted reviews from users with more than 3 reviews to minimize the impact of fake accounts and emphasize genuine feedback.

## How It Works

1. Filters out reviews from accounts with less than 3 reviews to focus on more reliable feedback.
2. Identifies the time frame of reviews, categorizing them as within the past month, past year, or older.
3. Calculates the score for each time frame: (number of 5-star reviews - number of 1-star reviews) / (number of trusted reviews)
4. The score highlights the impact of 5-star and 1-star reviews, as they provide stronger signals about the place's quality.
5. The user can select a specific time frame (past month, past year, or total) to view the corresponding score, offering a dynamic understanding of a place's quality over time.
